.SH NAME

.P
gammurc - gammu(1) configuration file 

.SH SYNOPSIS
.I /etc/gammurc
or 
.I ~/.gammurc
.SH DESCRIPTION
gammu(1) reads configuration from a config file. It's location is determined
on runtime. On Unix systems, it first tries ~/.gammurc and then falls back to
/etc/gammurc.

On Windows, user configuration is tried at profile/Application Data/gammurc
and then gammu falls back to current directory (./gammurc).

This file use ini file syntax, with comments being marked with both ; and #.
Sections of config file are identified in square brackets line [this]. All key
values are case insensitive.

Configuration file for gammu can contain several sections - [gammu], [gammu1],
[gammuN], ... Each section configures one connection setup and in default mode
gammu tries all of them in numerical order. You can also specify which
configuration section to use by giving it's number ([gammu] has number 0) as a
parameter to gammu(1) and it will then use only this section.

.TP
.BI Connection

Protocol which will be used to talk to your phone.

For Nokia cables you want to use one of following:

\fBfbus\fR           - serial FBUS connection
.br
\fBfbususb\fR        - FBUS over USB cable (experimental, for Nokia cables on Linux, including DKU-2)
.br
\fBdlr3\fR           - DLR-3 and compatible cables
.br
\fBdku2\fR           - DKU-2 and compatible cables
.br
\fBdku5\fR           - DKU-5 and compatible cables
.br
\fBmbus\fR           - serial MBUS connection

If you use some non original cable, you might need to append \-nodtr (eg. for
ARK3116 based cables) or \-nopower, but Gammu should be able to detect this
automatically.

For non-Nokia phones connected using cable you generally want:

\fBat\fR             - generic AT commands based connection

You can optionally specify speed of the connection, eg. at19200, but it is
not needed for modern USB cables.

For IrDA connections use one of following:

\fBirdaphonet\fR     - Phonet connection for Nokia phones.
.br
\fBirdaat\fR         - AT commands connection for most of phones (this is not supported on Linux).
.br
\fBirdaobex\fR       - OBEX (IrMC or file transfer) connection for most of phones.
.br
\fBirdagnapbus\fR    - GNapplet based connection for Symbian phones

For Bluetooth connection use one of following:

\fBbluephonet\fR     - Phonet connection for Nokia phones.
.br
\fBblueat\fR         - AT commands connection for most of phones.
.br
\fBblueobex\fR       - OBEX (IrMC or file transfer) connection for most of phones.
.br
\fBbluerfgnapbus\fR  - GNapplet based connection for Symbian phones

.TP
.BI Port

Device node or address of phone. It depends on used connection. 

For cables or emulated serial ports, you enter device name (for example
/dev/ttyS0, /dev/ttyACM0, /dev/ircomm0, /dev/rfcomm0 on Linux, /dev/cuad0 on
FreeBSD or COM1: on Windows). The special exception are DKU-2 and DKU-5 cables
on Windows, where the device is automatically detected from driver information
and this parameters is ignored.

For Bluetooth connection you have to enter Bluetooth address of your phone
(you can list Bluetooth devices in range on Linux using "hcitool scan"
command). Optionally you can also force Gammu to use specified channel by
includig channel number after slash.

Before using Gammu, your device should be paired with computer or you should
have set up automatic pairing.

For IrDA connections, this parameters is not used at all.

If IrDA does not work on Linux, you might need to bring up the interface and
enable discovery (you need to run these commands as root):

    ip l s dev irda0 up
    sysctl net.irda.discovery=1

.TP
.BI Model

Do not use this parameter unless really needed! The only use case for this is
when Gammu does not know your phone and misdetects it's features.

The only special case for using model is to force special type of OBEX
connection instead of letting Gammu try the best suited for selected
operation:

\fBobexfs\fR - force using of file browsing service (file system support)
.br
\fBobexirmc\fR - force using of IrMC service (contacts, calendar and notes
support)
.br
\fBobexnone\fR - none service chosen, this has only limited use for sending
file (\fBsendfile\fR command)

.TP
.BI SynchronizeTime

If you want to set time from computer to phone during starting connection.

.TP
.BI StartInfo 

This option allow to set, that you want (setting "yes") to see message on the
phone screen or phone should enable light for a moment during starting
connection. Phone will not beep during starting connection with this option.
This works only with some Nokia phones.

.TP
.BI GammuCoding

Forces using specified codepage (for example "1250" will force CP-1250 or
"utf8" for UTF-8). This should not be needed in most cases, Gammu should detect
it according to your locales.

.TP
.BI GammuLoc

Path to directory with localisation files (the directory should contain
LANG/LC_MESSAGES/gammu.mo). If gammu is properly installed it should find
these files automatically.

.TP
.BI LogFile

Path to file where information about communication will be stored.

.TP
.BI LogFormat

Determines what all will be logged to LogFile. Possible values are:

\fBnothing\fR     - no debug level
.br
\fBtext\fR        - transmission dump in text format
.br
\fBtextall\fR     - all possible info in text format
.br
\fBtextalldate\fR - all possible info in text format, with time stamp
.br
\fBerrors\fR      - errors in text format
.br
\fBerrorsdate\fR  - errors in text format, with time stamp
.br
\fBbinary\fR      - transmission dump in binary format

For debugging use either \fBtextalldate\fR or \fBtextall\fR, it contains all
needed information to diagnose problems.

.TP
.BI Features

Custom features for phone. This can be used as override when values coded in
common/gsmphones.c are bad or missing. Consult include/gammu-info.h for
possible values (all GSM_Feature values without leading F_ prefix). Please
report correct values to Gammu authors.

.TP
.BI Use_Locking

On Posix systems, you might want to lock serial device when it is being used
using UUCP-style lock files. Enabling this option (setting to yes) will make
Gammu honor these locks and create it on startup. On most distributions you
need additional privileges to use locking (eg. you need to be member of uucp
group).

This option has no meaning on Windows.
