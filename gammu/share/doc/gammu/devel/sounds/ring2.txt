  No.
  You can add/change 1 ringtone (Received tone) for a 61XX phone 
  using Datasuite though.

  Except for the downloaded ringtones which is available to most 
  nokia phones(GSM) except 5110, no.
  Maybe if you can understand the two byte(i guess, or was it 
  four) sequence for the tones notation in the PPM section and 
  have it manually changed to a tone of your desire then your 
  probably half way there.
  The other half would then be spent on how to get your phone to 
  accept the new PPM package you've just made without causing 
  any problems like Contact Service, sim locks, and Network 
  Access. Heck, I can't even change just the simple "Insert" 
  from "Insert SIM Card" to tresnI without causing my phone to 
  display Contact Service. Must have some security data 
  elsewhere.

  Anyway, we'll keep on trying.

  Hi mrENigma!
  U can not change a ringtone on your phone, U have only I think 
  2 byte free memory there u can recive one ringtone on it.
  Good luck!

  Well, I have a post of this a while (months) ago.
  It's not possible to ADD TONES to the Nokia 5110 but it is 
  possible to CHANGE TONES on the Nokia 5110.
  Well, changing RING TONES is a bit hard but changing ALERT 
  TONES is relatively easier to do.
  Of course us all Nokia users can add ring tones to phone like 
  the 61xx, 6210, 3210, 33xx, etc. but I bet most of our alert 
  tones are all the same.
  The beep, the standard (which is a dit-dit tone), the special 
  (which is a dit-dit-dit-dat-dat-dit-dit-dit, which is actually 
  a Morse code for "SMS"), and the ascending (which is actualy a 
  Morse code for "connecting people") are the same to all Nokia 
  phones unless there is one I don't know about.
  Anyway, have any of you once experienced when on a crowd when 
  a SMS message came and most people around you have Nokia 
  phones (riding a bus for example or on a bar).
  Some of us would check their phone if it was for them, like I 
  did.
  So I changed my standard tone which is a dit-dit to dit-dat to 
  sound differently. And my special tone from 
  dit-dit-dit-dat-dat-dit-dit-dit to 
  dat-dit-dit-dit-dat-dit-dit-dit (which sounds like "Who let 
  the dogs out" with dit-dit-dit at the end). So when I myself 
  received a message, I know that it's for me coz I only have to 
  take note of the tone.
  Too bad, Viper stopped his research with the NFREE project. I 
  have been inquiring about the checksums but he's no longer 
  responding. So I guess I have to do this on my own. 
  I'm coming up with a software to change the ringtone on the 
  5110, just like I came up with the soft for changing the alert 
  tone on my 5110. Imagine, we have 30 changeable ringtones on 
  our Nokia, not just the 5110 but also with the 3210, 33xx, 
  51xx, 61xx, 62xx, 7110, 82xx, 88xx, etc.
  The info about this is not for free of course. Anyone 
  experimenting with his Nokia can come with a way to change the 
  fixed ringtones and alert tones on his phone.
  BTW, the ringtones can be found on the PPM part of the phone.

  Yo Ice! Could you share with me the search values for the SMS 
  tones. Pleazzee.
  BTW, have you tried changing the words in our PPM package (i.e 
  "Insert" in Insert SIM card to something else). I've tried 
  even simply reversing Insert to tresnI so as not to get any 
  checksum problems but still I get the CS. 
  Maybe their using a different method of calculation (CRC 
  perhaps) or they have a compare module elsewhere?
  Just wondering,

  If the ringtones are saved in the ppm pack, and you get cs 
  when trying to change places of some letters in ppm.....what 
  happens in the phon when you download a new ringtone ?
  does it recalculate the cs for ppm itself ?
  I thought these ringtones where saved in a area without any cs 
  check.

  The downloaded tones aren't stored in your PPM, they are 
  stored in your EEPROM. It is in the EEPROM where checksum 
  recalculation takes place.
  The tones that are in the PPM are the static tones (i.e Ring 
  Ring, Mosquito).
  The SMS alert tones on the other hand (according to ICE 
  DRAGON) are located at the MCU portion of your flash.
  Hope this clears up the confusion.

  aCe

  Yo aCe! Here's the hex values particularly for the Special and 
  Ascending alerts tones.
  Using flash from a 5110v5.30C:
  For Special (morse code for "SMS"): 
  5A0C,400C,5A0C,400C,0AFE,5A0C,
  4025,0A01,5A25,400C,5A25,4025,
  0AFE,5A0C,400C,5A0C,400C,5A0C
  So it sounds like: 
  dit-dit-dit dat-dat dit-dit-dit
  "5A0C" is a "dit" with a duration of 0C
  "5A25" is a "dat" with a duration of 25
  "400C" is a pause with a duration of 0C
  "4025" is a pause with a duration of 25
  "0AFE" is.... I don't know what this means, let me know
  For Ascending (morse code for "connecting people"):
  5A25,400C,5A0C,0AFE,400C,5A25,400C,5A0C,4025,0A01,
  5A25,400C,5A25,0AFE,400C,5A25,4025,
  5A25,400C,5A0C,4025,
  5A25,400C,5A0C,4025,
  5A0C,4025,
  5A25,400C,5A0C,400C,5A25,400C,5A0C,4025,
  5A25,4025,
  5A0C,400C,5A0C,4025,
  5A25,400C,5A0C,4025,
  5A25,400C,5A25,400C,5A0C,4064
  5A0C,400C,5A25,400C,5A25,400C,5A0C,4025
  5A0C,4025
  5A25,400C,5A25,400C,5A25,4025
  5A0C,400C,5A25,400C,5A25,400C,5A0C,4025
  5A0C,400C,5A25,400C,5A0C,400C,5A0C,4025
  5A0C,4025
  So it sounds like:
  dat-dit-dat-dit dat-dat-dat dat-dit dat-dit dit 
  dat-dit-dat-dit dat dit-dit dat-dit dat-dat-dit 
  dit-dat-dat-dit dit dat-dat-dat dit-dat-dat-dit 
  dit-dat-dit-dit dit
  Again:
  "5A0C" is a "dit" with a duration of 0C
  "5A25" is a "dat" with a duration of 25
  "400C" is a pause with a duration of 0C
  "4025" is a pause with a duration of 25
  "4064" is a pause with a duration of 64 (long pause)
  "0A01" and "0AFE" are.... I don't know what these means, let 
  me know
  Correct me if I'm wrong, I think "0A01" and "0AEF" is a system 
  pause to let the user interrupt the beeping. for sure, it's 
  not a checksum.
  On other phone models:
  Read a full flash from any model of Nokia phone (from 3210, 
  33xx, 51xx, 61xx, 62xx, 7110, 82xx, 88xx) and use these search 
  strings on a hex editor (I use HexWorks):
  For alert tones: 8005020A01
  Following hex values after these hex are actual alert tones
  For ringtones: 0905020A01 or 0A05020A01
  Hex values following after these hex are not necessarily ring 
  tones but you can see the names of the ring tones and 
  following them are their ringtone values. Just see for 
  yourself what I mean.
  Can I ask one-thing? If any of you find these info 
  interesting, please rate me 
  Thanks and best regards...
  P.S. Oh, about changing the "Insert" to "tresnI" in PPM won't 
  work.
  You see, checksum calculation in PPM is not done by 
  byte-addition (byte added to another byte) but by 
  word-addition (two bytes added to the next two bytes).
  Let's take "Insert" as an example:
  Letter - Hex value - Decimal
  I 49 73
  n 6E 110
  s 73 115
  e 65 101
  r 72 114
  t 74 116
  In a byte-to-byte addition, the resulting checksum should be: 
  hex 275, decimal 629
  And it would be equal to the checksum of "tresnI"
  But in a word-to-word addition, checksum is computed in 
  byte-pairs, therefore taking "In" as one word or hex 
  equivalent to 496E, decimal 18798
  So if we are to add them in words:
  Letters - Hex values - Decimal
  In 496E 18798
  se 7365 29541
  rt 7274 29300
  The checksum should be: hex 2F47 or decimal 12103.
  Now with "tresnI", the first two letter pair would be "tr" 
  with a hex equivalent to 7472, decimal 29810.
  So if we are to add them in words:
  Letters - Hex values - Decimal
  tr 7472 29810
  es 6573 25971
  nI 6E49 28233
  The checksum should be: hex 482E or decimal 18478.
  Therefore, changing "Insert" to "tresnI" would yield a 
  "Contact Service" error.
  Again, I only ask one favor. If any of you find these info 
  interesting, please rate me 
  Cheers...

    salamat


  Not necessarily.
  Let's take the Standard alert tone (Morse code for "M") as an 
  example (using the 5110v5.30C flash):
  5519, 400A, 5519, 400A
  So it sounds like "dat-dat"
  5519 - is a "dat" with a duration of 19
  400A - is a pause with a duration of 0C
  We could change it to:
  550C, 400A, 5526, 400A
  So it sounds like "dit-dat"
  Take note that we subtracted hex 0D from the first 5519 and 
  added it to the second 5519 to compensate the values so we 
  wont have a contact service message.
  Here's a more interesting one. Change the Standard alert tone 
  (5519,400A, 5519,400A) to something like this:
  5B19, 4005, 4F19, 400F
  So it sounds like high-note-dat, low-note-dat
  Or to something like:
  4C0C, 4005, 5E25, 400F
  So it sounds like low-note-dit, high-note-dat
  Notice that we subtracted duration values from the first pause 
  and add it to the next pause, and so with the first tone to 
  the second tone.
  Sometimes I get an error when I subtract values from the pause 
  and add it to the tone. Or vice versa. It won't work.
  So the following won't work in changing Special alert (morse 
  code for "SMS"): 
  5A0C,400C,5A0C,400C,0AFE,5A0C,4025,
  0A01,5A25,400C,5A25,4025,0AFE,
  5A0C,400C,5A0C,400C,5A0C
  That sounds like: 
  dit-dit-dit dat-dat dit-dit-dit
  "5A0C" is a "dit" with a duration of 0C
  "5A25" is a "dat" with a duration of 25
  "400C" is a pause with a duration of 0C
  "4025" is a pause with a duration of 25
  "0AFE" is.... I don't know what this means, let me know
  Into a variation of "Let's go":
  5A0C,4025,5A0C,4025,0AFE,
  5A0C,400C,0A01,5A0C,400C,5A0C,400C,0AFE,5A0C,4025,
  5A0C,4025,5A0C
  That sounds like: 
  dit-dit dit-dit-dit-dit dit-dit
  "5A0C" is a "dit" with a duration of 0C
  "400C" is a pause with a duration of 0C
  "4025" is a pause with a duration of 25
  "0AFE" is.... I don't know what this means, let me know
  It wont work because we subtract values from pause and add it 
  to the tone.
  So that's that. I'm still studying the behaviour for the 
  default ringtones. 
  Sure I can change some values without incurring a "Contact 
  Service" but the tones won't make any sense.
  Anyway, I would know who reads this forum in my area when I 
  start hearing a different alert tone around here.
  P.S. If you find some info here to be interesting, I only ask 
  one thing: please rate me

  On a 6210:
  As always, before tinkering with your phone flash, make a full 
  backup of your phone flash if you haven't yet.
  Let's assume you don't have a full backup of your phone flash.
  1. Read the flash address 00200000 to 00600000.
  2. Copy the \flasher\flash.out to \nk_files\6210full.fls
  3. Use a hex editor (I suggest Hexworks), open the 
  \nk_files\6210full.fls and do the following to obtain a full 
  flash without the EEPROM:
  WARNING: If you notice the file contains FF00,FF00 from 
  beginning to end, DO NOT PROCEED because this is a bad read 
  flash.
  3.1 Go to address 3FC000 (this is equivalent to flash address 
  005FC000)
  3.2 Press Shift-Ctrl-Home. This will highlight the data from 
  offset 00000000 to 003FC000. Release the keys.
  3.3 Press Ctrl-C. This will copy the highlighted data to the 
  clipboard or memory.
  3.4 Press Ctrl-N. This will create an empty file.
  3.5 Press Ctrl-V. you will be asked "Are you sure you want to 
  insert?", select "Ok". 
  This will copy the previously highlighted data to the new 
  file. 
  3.6 Save the file as "my6210.fls"
  4. Make a copy of the flash that contains the alert tones. 
  4.1 Still using the hex editor, open the file "my6210.fls"
  4.2 Go to offset 350000. Press Shift-Ctrl-Home. This will 
  highlight the data from offset 00000000 to 003FC000. Release 
  the keys.
  4.3 Press Del. You will be asked "Are you sure you want to 
  delete?". Press "Ok". This will delete the data from 0 to 
  350000.
  4.4 Go to offset 10000. Press Shift-Ctrl-End. This will 
  highlight the data from offset 10000 to the end of file.
  4.5 Press Del. You will be asked "Are you sure you want to 
  delete?". Press "Ok". This will leave you a 64k data from 0 to 
  10000 (which is equivalent to flash address 00550000 to 
  00560000).
  4.6 Save the file as \nk_files\6210al.fls
  5. Copy \nk_files\6210al.fls to \nk_files\alert.fls
  6. Open the \nk_files\alert.fls with a hex editor (I use 
  Hexworks).
  7. Use the search string "8005020A01".
  First stop should be the Special alert tone.
  You will notice that there's "SMSS.......S.p.e.c.i.a.l" before 
  it.
  Pressing F3 will take you to the next found string. This is 
  the Standard alert. You will notice that there's 
  "SMS.......S.t.a.n.d.a.r.d" before it.
  Again pressing F3 will take you to the next found string. This 
  is the Ascending alert. You will notice that there's 
  "SMSL.......L.o.n.g. .l.o.u.d" before it.
  Don't forget when you flash it back, you should use alert.fls 
  as source and the address should be 00550000.
  Assuming you have flashed it back to the correct address and 
  it shows a "Contact Service", you may have incorrectly 
  modified your alert tone. If this happens, proceed to number 5.
  If you want to flash it back to its original alert tones, 
  flash it back with 6210al.fls at address 00550000. 
  But if it still has a Contact Service, flash it back with a 
  my6210.fls starting from address 00200000. This should restore 
  your original flash without the EEPROM part.
  This procedure is a little bit for advanced flasher users. If 
  you don't know what you're doing, don't try it out. You have 
  yourself to blame if something pukes up.
  Hmmm... I guess few people are interested in what I'm posting

  2.edit with hexworkshop and change the SMS alert
  3.try to correct checksums with NK1.2 to avoid Contact Service
  4.put flash back to phone

  Not only "sense" (cents), but also dollars... heh..heh...heh...
  I did that already but it always take a long wait to write the 
  whole modified flash back to the phone.
  With a 5110v530C flash, I also tried cutting the first part of 
  the modified flash (flash address 00200000-00210000), write it 
  back to the phone, then cut the last part of the modified 
  flash (002F0000-00300000) back to the phone so it would take a 
  much lesser time.
  The one I posted earlier is also to let our members reader 
  learn a little bit about the alert and ring tones in the 
  flash, and the possibility of changing them. Although I 
  believe that our members here know more than I do.
  Cheers to you... and best regards to all

  Man, thanks a lot for the values. I'll try it. 
  And about the word addition information. I'll try to make a 
  workaround on this if I have enough time. I've been off the 
  internet for a time.
  Thanks a lot man. You're great.

  Regards,
  aCe

  How does it works with a Nokia 3310?
  I think there are other HexValues, but I´m not able to find 
  them! Please help me!

  Still use the search string: "8005020A01".
  First stop should be the Special alert tone.
  You will notice that previously the tones have 5A0C, 400C, 
  5A25, 400C values. With the 3310, it uses the 5B0C, 400C, 
  5A25, 400c values.
  "5B0C" is a "dit" with a duration of 0C
  "5B25" is a "dat" with a duration of 25
  "400C" is a pause with a duration of 0C
  "4025" is a pause with a duration of 25
  Pressing F3 will take you to the next found string. This is 
  the Standard alert. It uses the 5619, 400A, 5618, 400A values.
  "5619" is a "dit" with a duration of 19
  "400A" is a pause with a duration of 0A
  Again pressing F3 will take you to the next found string. This 
  is the Ascending alert. It uses the 5B0C, 400C, 5B25, 400C 
  values.
  "5B0C" is a "dit" with a duration of 0C
  "5B25" is a "dat" with a duration of 25
  "400C" is a pause with a duration of 0C
  "4025" is a pause with a duration of 25
  The alert tones on the 3310 reside in the MCU part of the full 
  flash.
  Best regards and cheers...
